  abstract  = {The Mar\'{e}chal approximation for the Strehl ratio versus rms wavefront distortion is widely used in atmospheric scaling law codes, but a complete derivation is absent in the open literature. I present an updated derivation of the first term in Mar\'{e}chal, then a complete derivation. The Strehl ratio is proportional to the square of the Fourier transform of the probability density function of the random phase noise. For Gaussian noise, the traditional Mar\'{e}chal formulation is the result. The more general formulation suggests a method for characterization of random phase aberrations.}
