Introduction
===============

What is PAOS?
-----------------
`PAOS`, the Physical `Ariel` Optics Simulator, is an End-to-End physical optics propagation model of the `Ariel` Telescope
and subsystems.

`PAOS` was developed to demonstrate that even at wavelengths where it is not diffraction-limited
(:math:`\lambda < 3.0 \ \textrm{micron}`) `Ariel` still delivers high quality data for scientific analysis.

Having a generic input system which mimics the Zemax OpticStudio :math:`^{Â©}` interface, `PAOS` allows the user
expert in CAD modeling to simulate other optical systems, as well (see later in :ref:`Input system`).

`PAOS` simulates the complex wavefront along the propagation axis, and the Point Spread Function (PSF) at the focal planes.
To do so, `PAOS` implements the Paraxial theory described
in `Lawrence et al., Applied Optics and Optical Engineering, Volume XI (1992) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992aooe...11..125L>`_
(see later in :ref:`ABCD description`).

`PAOS` has been validated using the physical optics propagation library PROPER
(`John E. Krist, PROPER: an optical propagation library for IDL, SPIE (2007) <https://doi.org/10.1117/12.731179>`_) (see later in :ref:`Validation`).

In short, `PAOS` can study the effect of diffraction and aberrations impacting the optical performance and related systematics.
This allows performing a large number of detailed analyses, both on the instrument side and on the optimization of the
`Ariel` mission (see later in :ref:`Ariel`).


.. note::
    `PAOS` v 0.0.2 works on Python 3+
