``PAOS`` is a reliable, user-friendly, and open-source Physical Optics Propagation code that integrates an implementation of Fourier optics. It employs the Fresnel approximation for efficient and accurate optical system simulations. 

By including a flexible configuration file and paraxial ray-tracing, ``PAOS`` seamlessly facilitates the study of various optical systems, including non-axial symmetric ones, as long as the Fresnel approximation remains valid. 

This guide will walk you through the ``PAOS`` code with examples and descriptions of the main algorithms.
