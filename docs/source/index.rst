==================================
Welcome to `PAOS`'s documentation!
==================================

**Version**: |version|

``PAOS`` is a reliable, user-friendly, and open-source Physical Optics Propagation code that integrates an implementation of Fourier optics. It employs the Fresnel approximation for efficient and accurate optical system simulations. 

By including a flexible configuration file and paraxial ray-tracing, ``PAOS`` seamlessly facilitates the study of various optical systems, including non-axial symmetric ones, as long as the Fresnel approximation remains valid. 

This guide will walk you through the ``PAOS`` code with examples and descriptions of the main algorithms.

.. warning::

    This documentation is not completed yet. If you find any issue or difficulty, please contact the developers for help.

.. ``PAOS`` is still under development. If you have any issue or find any bug, please report it to the developers.
