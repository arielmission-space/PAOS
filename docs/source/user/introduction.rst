Introduction
===============

Accurate assessment of the optical performance of advanced telescopes and imaging systems for astrophysical applications is essential to achieve an optimal balance between optical quality, system complexity, costs, and risks. 

``PAOS`` is an open-source code implementing physical optics propagation (POP) in Fresnel approximation and paraxial ray tracing to analyze complex waveform propagation through both generic and off-axes optical systems (see :ref:`ABCD description` and :ref:`POP description`), enabling the generation of realistic Point Spread Functions across various wavelengths and focal planes. 

Developed using a Python 3 stack, ``PAOS`` includes an installer, documented examples, and **this** comprehensive guide. It improves upon other POP codes offering extensive customization options and the liberty to access, utilize, and adapt the software library to the user's application.

With a generic input system and a built-in Graphical User Interface (see :ref:`Input system`), ``PAOS`` ensures seamless user interaction and facilitates simulations.

The versatility of ``PAOS`` enables its application to a wide array of optical systems, extending beyond its initial use case. 
``PAOS`` presents a fast, modern, and reliable POP simulation tool for the scientific community, enhancing the assessment of optical performance in various optical systems and making advanced simulations more accessible and user-friendly.
