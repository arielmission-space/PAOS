.. _Compatibility of PAOS:

=======================
Compatibility of `PAOS`
=======================

`PAOS` is compatible with existing `Ariel` simulators, such as ArielRad
(`L. V. Mugnai, et al. ArielRad: the Ariel radiometric model. Exp Astron 50, 303–328 (2020) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10686-020-09676-7>`_),
and Exosim (`Sarkar, S., Pascale, E., Papageorgiou, A. et al. ExoSim: the Exoplanet Observation Simulator. Exp Astron 51, 287–317 (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10686-020-09690-9>`_).

Exosim is an end-to-end simulator that models noise and systematics in a dynamical simulation
and can capture temporal effects, such as correlated noise and systematics on the light curve.
`PAOS` can provide Exosim with representative aberrated PSFs that Exosim can use to create
realistic images on the focal planes of the instruments.
