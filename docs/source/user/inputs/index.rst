Input system
=======================

`PAOS` has a generic input system that mimics the Zemax OpticStudio interface to
allow the user expert in Computer Aided Design (CAD) modeling to simulate also
optical systems other than `Ariel`.

For instance, `PAOS` is used to simulate the optical performance of the
stratospheric balloon-borne experiment EXCITE
(`Tucker et al., The Exoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope (EXCITE) (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2314225>`_).
